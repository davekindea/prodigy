            <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
            <p>We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

        <div class="code_condact-body-scope">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code_condact-body-Enforcement">
            <h2>Enforcement</h2>
            <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us anonymously through email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

            </p>
            <p>
                Interns who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by us.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We prefer to receive a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than leave an incident unnoticed and unresolved, which could lead an individual or group to feel they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed not a violation will also help us improve our Code of Conduct and the processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report it, even if you are only an observer.
